# Monitoring Demo: Prometheus + Grafana + Alertmanager

This project is a fully working monitoring demo built to show how
existing systems — even those not designed for modern observability —
can be integrated with Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager without
rewriting them.

The demo uses a synthetic data source that simulates environmental
metrics (air quality, CO₂ levels, temperature) and demonstrates
collection, visualization, alerting, and notifications using open-source tools.


## What this demo shows

- Scraping data from a legacy-style HTML table using a custom exporter
- Collecting metrics with Prometheus
- Visualizing time-series and rankings in Grafana
- Triggering alerts based on thresholds and deltas
- Sending notifications to Gotify
- Exposing everything through a single Nginx entry point
- Running the entire stack using Docker Compose
